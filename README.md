# 2048 AI Bot!

This is a personal project that I've always wanted to try out, basically; with an optimal AI (I will end up determining what counts as optimal myself), how much does luck play into the game of 2048? So I'll run it X number of times and see what frequency the AI will manage to achieve 2048, 4096 etc. as the game goes on! :)

Completed:
- make project

Currently working on:
- setting up the game

Still to do:
Building the AI
